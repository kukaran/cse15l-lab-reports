Part 1:

Jimmy John (Student): 
    My tests aren't running! I don't understand!!!!

Jimmy Buckets (TA): 
    Use the java debugging tool, recompile with `-g` after `javac`. Then run `jdb "Your Test File"` 
    Then use the command `stop at "Your Test File":"Insert Line Number"` and insert the line number at the start of the test that is before 
    the test you want to debug. You can temporarily comment out any test if you want to debug a test after it with `//`. 
    Or use `@Before` to have a test run first if it's available.

Jimmy John (Student):
    Thank you so much for the help!


Part 2:

I learned how much you could do things by only using the command line. The ability to modify and edit files directly through terminal by using VIM editing tool,
as well as the ability to add, modify and commit files in github repositories.

Another thing I found very useful was the java debugging tool, which I found to be a great tool in understanding bugs in a program.
